\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}

In a world where digital communication is dominated by cloud-based platforms, concerns about privacy, surveillance, and dependency on external infrastructure are ever more pressing. Most messaging systems require accounts tied to corporations, rely on remote servers, and expose users to risks of data leaks or service outages. For small organizations, communities, or educational environments, this is neither desirable nor necessary. The Huxley Messaging Hub offers a compelling alternative: a self-contained, embedded messaging appliance built on the Raspberry Pi.

\subsection{Practical Applications}
Potential applications include secure local communication in offices, clinics, or labs; educational use as a training platform for networking and security concepts, and resilient communication in environments with unreliable internet, such as field stations or disaster-response zones.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
A Raspberry Pi–based system that enables user registration, authentication, and peer-to-peer message exchange with encryption. The device integrates a custom LED driver for real-time status indication and provides a foundation for modular extensions such as a local GUI or web access.
